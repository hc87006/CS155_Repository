/* 
Demonstrate that your program works: Include a printscreen of the 
results; if multiple dialog boxes are required to accomplish the task, 
just print the last one. 
*/
NOTES:
1) Parentheses / brackets should be lined up vertically to make it easy to visually see 
the start and end of a section of code. 
2) If you use tabs to align variables, code sections, etc. make sure the tab settings 
will allow a printed version to look good. Test your formatting by printing and 
looking at your printed code. 
3) Use comment lines liberally to make your code easy for someone to read and 
understand. 
4) Use spaces and blank lines between code sections to make the code even more 
readable. Remember, you may not be the only one looking at your code. 
5) Make sure your main class name is the same as the file name(e.g., if you use
public class ‘Foo’, the file should be named ‘Foo.cs’.  
6) Submit code online to GitHub. 
7) Include screenshots of the program running.
